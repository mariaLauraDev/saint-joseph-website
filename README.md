## About ‚ùì

Managing digital platforms is still a complex process for churches and religious organizations. I realize this in my volunteer work as a catechist in The S√£o Jos√© Church in Messejana. Most pastoral coordinators are older people who are not comfortable with digital media. Therefore, information about events and groups is only communicated person-to-person or with direct communication with the coordinators. This project desires to start the online church presence, to make information about activities most available to the faithful who attend it.
